AdWords API JavaScript Library - Using compiled scripts
=======================================================

If you are a developer who
- is interested in using the AdWords API JS library
- don't plan to use closure library in your project,
- is fine with downloading ~600KB uncompressed JS into your project
- do not wish to run other tools like closure compiler

then you can use the scripts in this folder. See index.htm for an example on
how to use the scripts inside this folder.
